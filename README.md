## Flowchart Overview

The flowchart provides a clear representation of how the **Student Information System** operates, detailing both **Admin** and **Student** workflows.

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Checks if the user is registered.
   - If not, redirects to new user registration.
   - Upon successful login, users are directed to their respective roles (Admin/Student).

2. **Admin Flow:**
   - Admin can manage student details by adding, updating, or deleting student profiles.
   - Admins can also handle course management, such as adding or modifying course details.

3. **Student Flow:**
   - Students can view or update their profile information.
   - They can register for courses, view grades, and check their attendance records.

4. **Data Flow:**
   - The system interacts with multiple databases, such as:
     - **Student Details Database**
     - **Course Details Database**
     - **Grades Database**
     - **Attendance Database**
   - Updates and changes are validated and stored across the relevant databases.
